# EVM
A simple  EVM using Arduino and Bolt IOT. [https://www.boltiot.com/]
This is a cloud based evm where the results of vote can be seen online. Anyone can view the result on demand. More over one can even monitor the votes in real time as they are be casted. This project is not meant for major election but can be used on a smaller scale such as in a university to select president of an student group or an association.
Modification for the evm can be done for additional security.


Add a finger print sensor and make use of a database
OR
add a buzer which gives short beeps when vote button is pressed just to notify the person monitoring if the particular person has casted his vote.
